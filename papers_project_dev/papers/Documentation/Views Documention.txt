Views documentation:
Below is a list of the functions present in the views.py file, along with descriptions of their function.

paper_list:
function description: Renders a list of all papers from the database, displaying them on a 'paper_list.html' template.

paper_detail:
function description: Displays the details of a specific paper identified by its primary key (pk). Allows users to add or update notes about the paper via a form, redirecting to the paper's detail page upon successful submission.

upload_json:
function description: Handles the upload of a JSON file containing paper data, parses it, and updates the database with the new paper information. Provides error messages if the file is not found, contains invalid JSON, or if other exceptions occur.

run_arxiv_script:
function description: Executes a Django management command to query arXiv for new papers, and redirects to the paper list page, showing a success or error message based on the outcome.

search_papers:
function description: Searches for papers in the database based on a query string from the request. Returns a list of papers that match the search term, displayed on the 'paper_list.html' template.

fetch_summary:
function description: Fetches the summary of a paper from arXiv using its identifier (arxiv_id). Returns the summary text if successful or None if an error occurs.

upload_papers:
function description: Handles various POST requests to either find similar papers based on arXiv links, run an arXiv query, or upload paper data from a JSON file. Shows success or error messages based on the operation performed.

average_paper:
function description: Renders a template with a placeholder message indicating that the average paper feature is coming soon.

fetch_and_process_papers:
function description: Fetches the most recent papers from arXiv, computes their embeddings, and saves the processed papers to a file. Returns a success message if papers are processed or an error message if no papers are fetched.

fetch_papers:
function description: Queries arXiv for recent papers in the Machine Learning category, retrieves their titles, summaries, links, and publication dates, and returns this information as a list.

compute_embeddings:
function description: Computes the embeddings for a list of papers using a SentenceTransformer model and adds these embeddings to each paper's data.

save_papers_to_file:
function description: Saves a list of papers with their embeddings to a specified file path in JSON format.

trends_closest_view:
function description: Loads a file containing papers with embeddings, calculates the distance of each paperâ€™s embedding from the mean embedding, and renders a template displaying the top 5 closest papers.

trends_scatter_view:
function description: Loads embeddings from two datasets, applies t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, adds jitter to the points, and creates an interactive Plotly scatter plot visualizing these embeddings. Renders the plot on a 'trends_scatter.html' template.

fetch_and_trends_view:
function description: Renders a template for the fetch and trends feature, displaying a placeholder view.
